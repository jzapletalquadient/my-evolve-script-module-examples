# Csv Transformation Example

## Build the script

As was described in the main README:
In commandline switch to the folder `csv-transform-example` and run the
following command:

$ bb b

As a result, there should be a file a.js in folder dist. This is the javascript
that should be uploaded to Evolve.

## Create Pipeline

Following pictures illustrate the pipeline.

**Note**: In the "Print" step it is necessary to provide a real path to
the `LifeInsuranceQuote_jsonInput.wfd` file in the `ICM Sample Solutions` folder.

The `DataInput` must point to the `request.json` file in the `Working Folder`.
