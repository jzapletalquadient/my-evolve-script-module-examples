# Evolve Script Module Examples
This repository contains examples of custom pipeline modules written in typescript.

## Pre-requisities
Following tools are needed to be installed to be able to build the example modules.
 - NodeJS
 - Yarn
 - [Bobril build](https://github.com/bobril/bbcore)

## Json transformation
### How to build
in folder [json-transform-example](json-transform-example) run the following command:

```shell
$ bb b
```

As a result, there should be a file `a.js` in folder `dist`. This is the javascript that should be
uploaded to Evolve.

The script module can be tested with data file [example-input.json](json-transform-example/example-input.json)
